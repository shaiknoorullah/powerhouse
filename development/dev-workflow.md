I have a very sophisticated, carefully planned and put together workflow for almost anything and since I work in multiple domains, I have tried to make my workflow as productive as possible. below, are a few Metrics, based on which the decisions are going to be made for
1. Tools
2. Workflow

the metrics are:
1. isolation of domain
2. fast navigation, intuitive
3. minimalistic
4. keyboard driven
5. terminal centric
6. container centric (for tools, and envs)
7. stateful, history aware
8. restrictive
9. centrally managed


### Some common tools
