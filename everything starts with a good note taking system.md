### Foundations

> [!QUOTE]
> The basis of an efficient productive system is a good note-taking system


#### **But why do you need a good note taking system? what possible value could it bring?**

To understand this better, we must first revisit the traditional methods of note-taking. Earlier, students used to listen to and interact with live lectures and simultaneously write down notes. Let's analyze this from a critical standpoint.

1. The student must divide/categorize their notes into different segments (maybe based on subject, topic, professor, year or school, etc)
2. The student must always carry the notes physically with them when needed to study
3. The student must remember what kind of note is present in which note (some times, the same subject per year has multiple books)

Now, Based on the 3 points we analyzed in traditional methods of note-taking, Let's see how they might be a hindrance to a productive system and then, we'll make from the observations, we'll build a foundational model of what a productive note taking system should look like.
During this, we'll try to be unbiased and non-inclined towards any specific tool or methodology, but rather on what qualities or abilities it must posses.

#### Observations

##### 1. **Division of the information:**

here, dividing the notes could present with some problems like
	1. having no record where a particular piece of information exists.
	2. finding a particular piece of information might become tiresome as you might need to carry around a bunch of notebooks always
	3. you must choose a division strategy and pray that you chose right. For example, if you divide by topic, there might be information which simultaneously belongs to both topics or if you divided based on subject, you might have overlapping sub categories of a subject that might be duplicated

##### 2. **Physical Dependency / No guaranteed availability**:

here, we observe that in order to access the information, we would need physical access to notebooks. But not just one notebook, we would need access to all the notebooks. (imagine if you had to carry around every notebook you ever wrote around)

##### 3. **Non Indexed / Stranded Information**:

here, we observe that we must also somehow remember the exact location of any arbitrary piece of information is present which is impossible thereby adding more effort into finding and maintaining information


#### Conclusion

**Based on the observations we made in the section above, we can now build the foundational requirement for a productive note-taking system**

##### Rule 1: **Proper segregation strategy (Hierarchical OR Characteristic)**:

Segregation of information is a subjective matter, while one might prefer Hierarchical segregation others might prefer segregation based on characteristics of the information. But what is Hierarchical or Characteristic segregation?

###### **Hierarchical Segregation**:
**Hierarchical segregation** is when the information to be recorded is known to have structure and hierarchy, you can segregate the information based on its hierarchical inheritance. For example: if you're researching about food, you might segregate based on Food type (vegetables, fruits, grains, synthetic, artificial, etc) here, if you wanted to add a note about apple, you'd add it under fruits which belongs to food as a category. so the hierarchy would be **Food**->**Fruits**->**Apple** this is straight forward.

###### **Characteristic Segregation**:
**Characteristic segregation** is when you do not care about the structure or hierarchy of the information metadata but rather you care about certain characteristics that you decide. One objective benefit this brings is that this method decreases the cognitive load about [where the note should be placed?]([[everything starts with a good note taking system#3. **Non Indexed / Stranded Information**]])

##### Rule 2: **Easy & Fast Navigation**:
**Easy & Fast Navigation** of the notes makes sense because spending time and unnecessary efforts in finding notes is counter productive

---
##### Rule 3: **Globally Available**:
Having the system **Globally Available** where ever you go further reduces overhead about unnecessary dependencies (eg: needing to carry a diary everywhere)

---
##### Rule 4: **Searchable indexing**:
Finding ways to make the information searchable and indexing is necessary to make it possible to search your notes fast and efficient.

---

#### Goals:

Now that we have gone through some of the requirements or rather characteristics a **Productive** Note-taking system must have, let's briefly go through some of the goals we'd want to achieve through such a system.

I have been working across many domains for the past few years ranging from management to operations to sales, marketing & engineering.
each person depending on what domain they work on and what role they have in that domain might completely change the goal for that person.
Regardless, there are some Goals that could be set as universal goals through which everybody can benefit irrelevant of their domain, expertise, knowledge, experience or role.

1. To have a unified input layer for efficient consumption of knowledge and information
2. To have a log/journal of life, to track, analyze and improve upon
3. To have a system that allows for inspiration through previously gathered knowledge
4. To facilitate deeper understanding of concepts by forcing your brain to translate, and abstract the gathered knowledge
5. To structure the output layer for efficient production of knowledge & experience
