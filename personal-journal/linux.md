### Hyprland

after setting up Hyprland and using it for quite a while, I have a few bottlenecks or inefficiencies that I want to address.

1. On a laptop, I can only have maximum 2 windows open at a time on one workspace and on my ultrawide 34" monitor, that goes up to 3 or 4. 4 becomes a little tight and due to this, I have to place other windows on other workspaces. Now, If those applications are together, I'd have to switch between these workspaces constantly which decreases my productivity. Therefore, I need to have multiple windows open in a single container group as windows with overlay, and the background of the top most window (active window) must not be affected by the ones behind it. these tabs must able to be cycled through.
